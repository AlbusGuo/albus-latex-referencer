# LaTeX Referencer for Obsidian

> [!important]
> This plugin is forked form [https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-latex-theorem-equation-referencer](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-latex-theorem-equation-referencer). The original plugin cannot satisfy my own needs, so I tried to make something new!


# What's changed

- Chinese is now available.
- Adding a new theorem callouts' style named `card`.
- Adding two new index for theorem callouts.
- Now the front-end plugins `quick-preview` and `mathlinks` have now been integrated.

The other features are not changed.
